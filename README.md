# Burger-App

This is an app for a burger restaurant that displayed the burgers currently on the menu and allows the user to add a new type of burger. Once added to the menu, the burger can be devoured. It will then move to a new portion of the app where the user can track which burgers have been devoured. All burgers are stored, along with whether or not they have been devoured.
